# Deep Recurrent Survival Ranking (DRSR)

A `tensorflow` implementation of DRSA model. This is the experiment code for our SIGIR 2020 paper "[A Deep Survival Model for Unbiased Ranking](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.14714.pdf)".

If you have any problems, please feel free to contact the authors [Jiarui Jin](jinjiarui97@gmail.com) and [Yuchen Fang](arthur_fyc@sjtu.edu.cn). 
We are working with Alibaba Group to push the process of making code public.
Sorry for the delay due to COVID-19, and the code will come soon.
